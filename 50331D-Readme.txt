50331D - Windows Client, Enterprise Desktop Support Technician

Class Delivery: 
This 3 - 5 day instructor-led course provides students with the knowledge and skills needed to isolate, document and resolve problems on Windows Desktops on a corporate network. The material is geared towards corporate IT technicians that support Windows 11 and older clients (Windows 7 is the earliest client supported). Setup resources are now included with student materials to allow them to recreate the classroom environment on their own network or on virtual machines in Microsoft Azure.
  
Customized deliveries of 50331D are possible in 3-day, 4-day or 5-day configurations.  Classes taught for technicians supporting Windows 10 or 11 should use the 50331D_Syllabus.pdf or 50331D-ENU_WindowsClient_Curriculum.pdf file to choose the correct modules.  

For additional help in configuring such deliveries, please read the Trainer Preparation Guide (50331D-ENU_TrainerPreparationandNotes.pdf) or contact the author (neil@neiltucker.biz).  


Microsoft Azure Delivery:

On the Microsoft Azure web-site (http://www.azure.com), have students sign up for a free subscription if this is the method of doing labs chosen by the instructor.


PowerShell Tutorial:
Trainers that decide to include the PowerShell tutorial should keep in mind that the included labs could add an additional 4 hours to class time.  Updates to this tutorial can be found on GitHub (https://github.com/neiltucker/powershell_essentials).
